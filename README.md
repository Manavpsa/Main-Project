# Main Project

 # Identification of Pulmonary Abnormalities using Lung Sound Classification

 Spearheaded the development of a cutting edge system designed to classify lung sounds into Crackles and Wheezes, serving as a pivotal diagnostic aid within primary healthcare settings. Utilized advanced machine learning models such as VGG16 and RESNET18 alongside signal processing techniques in Python to analyse spectrograms of lung sounds. Integrated the system with a resource-constrained microcontroller, Arduino UNO, by optimizing model architectures and implementing real-time classification algorithms in C++. Orchestrated the software development process, ensuring seamless integration of components and rigorous testing to guarantee robust performance in real-world healthcare scenarios.
